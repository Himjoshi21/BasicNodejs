What is Node.js? (In simple words)

Node.js lets you run JavaScript outside the browser.

👉 Normally:

JavaScript runs in Chrome / browser

Used for buttons, forms, UI stuff

👉 With Node.js:

JavaScript runs on your computer/server

Used for backend (APIs, servers, databases)

📌 Example:

Browser JS → “User clicked button”

Node.js → “Save user data in database”

🤔 Why do we use Node.js?

Because it is:

⚡ Fast (built on Chrome’s V8 engine)

🔄 Non-blocking (can handle many users at once)

📦 Same language for frontend & backend (JavaScript)

🌍 Used by big companies (Netflix, Uber, PayPal)

🧠 How Node.js Works (Easy logic)

Node.js works on event-based system.

Think like this 👇
🧍 User → Request → 🖥️ Server → Response

Node.js:

Does not wait for one task to finish

Moves to next task

Comes back when result is ready

This is called Non-blocking / Asynchronous

📂 Basic Parts of Node.js
1️⃣ Node Runtime

Runs JavaScript code on server

2️⃣ NPM (Node Package Manager)

Used to install libraries

Example:

npm install express

3️⃣ Modules

Small pieces of code you reuse

Example:

const fs = require("fs"); // file system module

📁 Important Core Modules (Simple)
Module	What it does
fs	Work with files
http	Create server
path	File paths
os	System info
